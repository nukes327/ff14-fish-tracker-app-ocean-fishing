## Notes/Issues

 - Only blue fish (and their intuition fishes) are added
 - Blue fish windows are always 45 minutes starting on the hour, when the boat begins boarding
 - Ocean fish location is always The Tempest because I had to put it as something
 - Ocean fish are marked as Patch 5.0 because idk what they are
 - Green fish/intuition fish show up with an availability of Always for simplicity
 - No i18n stuff
 - Importing/exporting works, even with Lalachievements
